# Friend-Finder
Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

# Overview

I built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. 

This full-stack site takes in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. 

The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 

I use Express to handle routing.

Deployed on Heroku so other users can fill it out.
